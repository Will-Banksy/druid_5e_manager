// TODO: Create an Advanced List that acts like a List but with some features
//     1. Automatically adds a button (or additional empty item) to add elements to the List (Hm actually not sure on this one)
//     2. Supports filtering, optionally via stuff in env or data
//     3. Supports sorting, optionally via stuff in env or data
//
//     I need to think about what exactly I want here and what the use cases would be and also should it be a list or a table?
//         Maybe I can make an advanced table that uses an advanced list under the hood...
